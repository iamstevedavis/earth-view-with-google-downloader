# Earth View with Google Downloader

**Note: This project no longer works because [Earth View with Google](https://earthview.withgoogle.com/) has been taken down.**

This script was designed to download all the images from Earth View with Google.

As a simple quality check, the script verified that every image downloaded was at least 1800Ã—1200 using ImageMagick. This check was optional and required ImageMagick to be installed on your system.

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The script prompted for a save directory and whether to verify image quality using ImageMagick.
